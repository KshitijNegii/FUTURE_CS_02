# FUTURE_CS_02 - Security Operations Center (SOC) Monitoring & Incident Response

## 📖 Overview
As part of my cybersecurity internship with **Future Interns**, this task focused on SOC operations: monitoring security alerts, analyzing suspicious activities, and simulating incident response using SIEM tools like Splunk.  
This project simulates how SOC teams detect threats, analyze logs, and respond to potential incidents in real-world organizations.

---

## ✅ Key Highlights
- Set up Splunk SIEM (cloud version) for monitoring.  
- Analyzed **failed logins, brute-force attempts, and malware alerts** from provided logs.  
- Created queries to detect anomalies in logs.  
- Drafted a professional **Incident Response Report** and **Stakeholder Communication Update**.  

---

## 🎯 Skills Gained
- SOC monitoring & log analysis  
- SIEM (Splunk) basics  
- Threat detection & incident triage  
- Incident response documentation  
- Communication with stakeholders  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Splunk Cloud** – SIEM platform for log monitoring  
- **CSV sample security logs**  
- **Kali Linux Terminal** – for curl tests & file handling  
- **Markdown** – report writing
